This is the repository for all the .r codes accompanying the lessons of Kirill Eremenko in the course
"R Programming A-Z". The codes have comments in them acting as notes for the lessons.
Running the code while following the comments should act as a good refresher for R language.

This is also a practice for understanding the principles of git for my better understanding.
